# cigarette_smokers_lab

Assume a cigarette requires three ingredients to make and smoke: tobacco, paper, and matches. There are three smokers around a table, each of whom has an infinite supply of one of the three ingredients â€” one smoker has an infinite supply of tobacco, another has paper, and the third has matches.

There is also a non-smoking agent who enables the smokers to make their cigarettes by arbitrarily (non-deterministically) selecting two of the supplies to place on the table. The smoker who has the third supply should remove the two items from the table, using them (along with their own supply) to make a cigarette, which they smoke for a while. Once the smoker has finished his cigarette, the agent places two new random items on the table. This process continues forever.

Three semaphores are used to represent the items on the table; the agent increases the appropriate semaphore to signal that an item has been placed on the table, and smokers decrement the semaphore when removing items. Also, each smoker has an associated semaphore that they use to signal to the agent that the particular smoker is done smoking; the agent has a process that waits on each smoker's semaphore to let the agent know that it can place the new items on the table.

A simple pseudocode implementation of the smoker who has the supply of tobacco might look like the following:
```python
def tobacco_smoker():
    repeat:
        paper.wait()
        matches.wait()
        smoke()
        tobacco_smoker_done.signal()
```
However, this can lead to deadlock; if the agent places paper and tobacco on the table, the smoker with tobacco may remove the paper and the smoker with matches may take the tobacco, leaving both unable to make their cigarette. The problem is to define additional processes and semaphores that prevent deadlock, without modifying the agent.
